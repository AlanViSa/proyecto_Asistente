## Instructions for Verification

### Verify Local API Server
1. Start the server: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
2. Check health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`
3. Check services endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/services`
4. Check metrics endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/metrics`

### Verify Docker Environment
1. Build and start containers: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Check container status: `docker-compose ps`
3. Access the application: Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser
4. Access Prometheus: Open `http://localhost:9090` in a browser
5. Access Pushgateway: Open `http://localhost:9091` in a browser
6. Access Grafana: Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser (login with admin/admin)

### Verify Monitoring
1. In Prometheus UI, go to Status > Targets to verify application scraping
2. In Prometheus UI, go to Status > Rules to verify alerts
3. In Grafana, go to Dashboards to verify Salon Assistant dashboard is present
4. Generate traffic using the test script: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test_metrics.ps1`
5. Generate test metrics: `python scripts/generate_test_metrics.py 30 10`

### Test Backup System
1. Run a manual backup: `docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres salon_assistant > backup.sql`
2. Verify the backup file: `ls -la backup.sql`

### Next Steps After Verification
1. Document any issues found during verification
2. Create a production deployment plan
3. Set up automated testing
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement any missing features
